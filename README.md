# picoCTF 2025 challenge writeups
All my solutions/writeups are in here. The only challenges that aren't included are:
- Fantasy CTF (...)
- Cookie Monster Secret Recipe (the flag was in your cookies)
- EVEN RSA CAN BE BROKEN??? (N had 2 as one of its factors)
- hashcrack (use `hashcat`)
- guess-my-cheese-2 (trick was to make the cheeses lowercase)
- bitlocker-2 (the solution was `strings memdump.mem | grep picoCTF{`)
- ricochet (couldn't solve it)
- pachinko revisted (couldn't solve it)
- ses (couldn't solve it)

If you find this useful, come check out my CTF writeups website for more detail on my solutions to `handoff`, `echo-valley`, and `perplexed`!

If you have a better/cleaner solution or a solution for an unsolved challenge here, feel free to make a PR!
