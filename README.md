All my solutions for every challenge I solved is in here. The only challenges that aren't included are
- Fantasy CTF
- Cookie Monster Secret Recipe (the flag was in your cookies)
- EVEN RSA CAN BE BROKEN??? (N had 2 as one of its factors)
- hashcrack (use hashcat)
- guess-my-cheese-2
- bitlocker-2 (the solution was `strings memdump.mem | grep picoCTF{`)
- ricochet (couldn't solve it)
- pachinko revisted (couldn't solve it)
- ses (couldn't solve it)
